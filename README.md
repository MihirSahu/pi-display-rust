# Pi Display gtk-rs

A simple gtk4-rs application I designed to display metrics on my [3.5 inch mini monitor](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806581111560.html).
Isn't useful because my raspberry pi runs Debian Bullseye, which doesn't support gtk 4. I wrote the program with gtk-rs, which only supports gtk 4.
